# Address-missing-data
#### Introduction
The datasets that data professionals use to solve problems typically contain missing values, which must be dealt with in order to achieve clean, useful data. This is particularly crucial in exploratory data analysis (EDA). In this activity, you will learn how to address missing data.

You are a financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked your team with identifying new business opportunities. To help them decide which future companies to invest in, you will provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as "unicorns." Your client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.

The investor has asked you to provide them with the following data:

* Companies in the hardware industry based in either Beijing, San Francisco, or London
* Companies in the artificial intelligence industry based in London
* A list of the top 20 countries sorted by sum of company valuations in each country, excluding United States, China, India, and United Kingdom
* A global valuation map of all countries with companies that joined the list after 2020
* A global valuation map of all countries except United States, China, India, and United Kingdom (a separate map for Europe is also required)
Your dataset includes a list of businesses and data points, such as the year they were founded; their industry; and their city, country, and continent.
